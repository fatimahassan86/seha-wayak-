📌 Project Overview

This project is a healthcare service web app prototype built with Base44, inspired by digital health platforms such as Sehhaty (Saudi Health Services) and SEHA (Abu Dhabi Health Services Company). These platforms provide users with digital access to healthcare services, appointment booking, medical records, consultations, and more.

This repository contains the source code for a web application that serves as a health services user interface, mimicking or demonstrating functionality similar to official health service apps.
